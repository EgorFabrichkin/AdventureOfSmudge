# Adventure Of Smudge

Introducing my Pet Project, which is a hypercasual 2D platformer.

Brief description: the player jumps on platforms of different colors on the infinitely generated level, 
during the jump the player's color changes randomly, the number of jumps is limited, if the color of the player and the platform matches, 
the player fails, on some platforms there are boosters that add the number of possible jumps. 
The game lasts until the player runs out of jumps or he falls off the platform
